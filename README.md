# Remap Menu Key

A mod that (in a hacky, taped together type of way) fixes a [years old](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-252336) bug because mojang doesn't care about us `caps:swapescape` users :(  

Adds a keybinding in the settings that lets said key be used as an alternative escape key.
Because the escape key is otherwise impossible to set as a keybinding, the default is the escape key so it can always to reset to the default.
